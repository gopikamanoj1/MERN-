1. **Data**: The value or information stored in the node.
2. **Next**: A reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.

### **Structure of a Singly Linked List Node**

Each node in a singly linked list has the following structure:



### **Basic Operations**

1. **Creating a Node**: A new node is created with a value and a `next` pointer initially set to `null`.

2. **Inserting a Node**:
   - **At the Beginning**: To insert a node at the beginning, make the new node's `next` pointer point to the current head of the list and then update the head to be the new node.
   - **At the End**: To insert a node at the end, traverse the list to find the last node and update its `next` pointer to point to the new node.
   - **At a Specific Position**: To insert a node at a specific position, traverse the list to find the node after which the new node should be inserted and update the pointers accordingly.

3. **Deleting a Node**:
   - **From the Beginning**: Update the head to point to the second node.
   - **From the End**: Traverse the list to find the second-last node and set its `next` pointer to `null`.
   - **From a Specific Position**: Traverse the list to find the node before the one to be deleted and update the pointers to bypass the node to be deleted.

4. **Traversing the List**: To visit each node in the list, start from the head and follow the `next` pointers until you reach the end (`null`).

5. **Searching for a Node**: Traverse the list to find a node with a specific value.




### **Advantages of Singly Linked Lists**

1. **Dynamic Size**: The size of a singly linked list can grow or shrink dynamically, making it suitable for applications where the size of the data structure is not known in advance.
2. **Efficient Insertions/Deletions**: Insertions and deletions at the beginning of the list are efficient and take constant time, \(O(1)\).

### **Disadvantages of Singly Linked Lists**

1. **No Direct Access**: Nodes in a singly linked list cannot be directly accessed by index. You have to traverse the list from the head to find a specific node, which can be inefficient (linear time, \(O(n)\)).
2. **More Memory Overhead**: Each node requires additional memory for storing the `next` pointer.





Here are the applications of a singly linked list:

1. **Implementing Stacks**
2. **Implementing Queues**
3. **Managing Memory Pools**
4. **Graph Adjacency Lists**
5. **Polynomial Representation**
6. **Sparse Matrix Representation**
7. **Implementing Hash Tables (with Chaining)**
8. **Undo Functionality in Applications**
9. **Navigating Through Browsing History**
10. **Music Playlists**
11. **Handling Large Numbers (Arbitrary-Precision Arithmetic)**
12. **Round-Robin Scheduling in Operating Systems**



Singly linked lists are a fundamental data structure that provide flexibility and efficient insertions and deletions, making them useful in a variety of applications.
