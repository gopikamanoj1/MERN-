In JavaScript, when we talk about events, we are usually referring to things that happen on a web page, like a user
clicking a button, typing into a form, or the page finishing loading. These events can be broadly categorized into two
types: native events and synthetic events. Let's break these down:

### Native Events
Native events are real, browser-generated events that occur as a result of user interactions or other browser actions.
Examples include:

- **Click Event:** When a user clicks on a button.
- **Keydown Event:** When a user presses a key on the keyboard.
- **Load Event:** When a web page or an image has finished loading.

These events are automatically recognized and handled by the browser.

### Synthetic Events
Synthetic events, on the other hand, are events that are created and dispatched by your code. These are not generated by
actual user interactions but are simulated to mimic the native events. For instance, you might want to trigger a click
event on a button without the user actually clicking it. This can be done using synthetic events.

Hereâ€™s an example of each in JavaScript:

#### Native Event Example
When a user clicks a button, an alert will be shown:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<body>

    <button id="myButton">Click Me</button>

    <script>
        document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function () {
            alert("Button was clicked!");
        });
    </script>

</body>

</html>
```

#### Synthetic Event Example
Creating and dispatching a click event programmatically:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<body>

    <button id="myButton">Click Me</button>

    <script>
        document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function () {
            alert("Button was clicked!");
        });

        // Creating and dispatching a synthetic click event
        var event = new Event('click');
        document.getElementById("myButton").dispatchEvent(event);
    </script>

</body>

</html>
```

In this second example, even though there was no actual user clicking the button, the event listener for the click event
was triggered, and the alert was shown. This is because we created a synthetic event and dispatched it to the button.

### Key Differences
1. **Origin:**
- **Native Events:** Generated by the browser due to user interactions.
- **Synthetic Events:** Created and dispatched by your code.

2. **Usage:**
- **Native Events:** Direct response to user actions.
- **Synthetic Events:** Used for testing, automation, or triggering events programmatically.

Native Events: Handling actual user interactions, such as when a user fills out and submits a form, clicks a button, or
navigates through the website.

Synthetic Events: Automating form submissions, testing user interfaces by simulating clicks or other actions, and
triggering specific behaviors in response to certain conditions or events.
