| Definition               | A React component that implements `shouldComponentUpdate`      | A function that always returns the same output for the same input without side effects |
| Purpose                  | To optimize rendering by preventing unnecessary re-renders     | To ensure predictable behavior and easy testing                                        |
| State Management         | Can have internal state and manage its own lifecycle           | Stateless; relies on input parameters only                                             |
| Side Effects             | May have side effects (e.g., updating state, DOM manipulation) | No side effects; does not modify external state                                        |
| Reusability              | Reusable but dependent on its state and props                  | Highly reusable; depends solely on input parameters                                    |
| Input                    | Receives props and/or state                                    | Receives parameters                                                                    |
| Output                   | Renders JSX based on props and state                           | Returns a value based on input parameters                                              |
| Performance Optimization | Uses shallow comparison to determine if re-render is needed    | Inherently optimized; no state or side effects to manage                               |
| Example                  | ```jsx                                                         |

class MyPureComponent extends React.PureComponent {
render() {
return <div>{this.props.value}</div>;
}
}
`|`javascript
function add(a, b) {
return a + b;
}

````|
| Usage in React              | Typically used to prevent unnecessary re-renders              | Often used to create utility functions or stateless logic    |
| Lifecycle Methods           | Can use lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, etc.      | No lifecycle methods                                         |

### Pure Component in React

A **pure component** in React is a component that does not re-render if its props and state have not changed. It implements a shallow comparison of props and state in the `shouldComponentUpdate` lifecycle method.

#### Example:
```javascript
import React from 'react';

class MyPureComponent extends React.PureComponent {
  render() {
    console.log('Rendering MyPureComponent');
    return <div>{this.props.value}</div>;
  }
}

// Usage
<MyPureComponent value="Hello, Gopika!" />
````

### Pure Function in JavaScript

A **pure function** in JavaScript is a function that, given the same input, will always return the same output and does not have any observable side effects.

#### Example:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Usage
console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
```

### Conclusion

Understanding the differences between pure components and pure functions helps in writing optimized and predictable code. Pure components help in optimizing React applications by reducing unnecessary re-renders, while pure functions help in maintaining predictable and testable logic in your codebase.
